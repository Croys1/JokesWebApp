# JokesWebApp

JokesWebApp is a dynamic web application that uses Apache Tomcat V9 and SQL to create a jokes message board. Users can register or log in to an account to add friends, post, like and, review other users' jokes. 

This program was developed as an assignment for my database course so most of the focus was on the functionality of the database and not the front end design so forgive me for the lackluster appearance. The database normalized and containing six entities with well-defined relationships. 

That being said to make this a practical web application it needs a few things: passwords need to be encrypted for storage, pages need to be restricted until a user signs in, etc

# To Run the App

To run the application you need to have an active connection to an SQL server and Apache Tomcat V9 installed. Can download the source files and use them in your way or import the jokes.War file to create the app the way it is.

If you have any issue with code or possible suggestions for improving the database please take a fork.
